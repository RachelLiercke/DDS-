# Case 1 Beers and Breweries study-
The purpose of this case study was to perform an analysis of the beers and breweries datasets provided to us by Budweiser and to answer the questions they had. In this Repositiory, we will have our presentation, Rmarkdown (along with the knit file), this ReadME and our code. 
Feel free to take a look at our analysis and ask us any questions!
